## Our Work and Goals

The surface-processes group at the University of Minnesota blends **field investigations**, **numerical modeling**, **geospatial analyses**, **laboratory experiments**, and **instrumentation design and fabrication** to address changes in past and present glaciers and ice sheets, river systems, sea level, and landscapes.

## Ethos

* Statement on importance of Earth-surface Science
* Statement on equity, diversity, and inclusion
