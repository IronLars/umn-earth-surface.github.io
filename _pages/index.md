## Our Work and Goals

The surface-processes group at the University of Minnesota blends **field investigations**, **numerical modeling**, **geospatial analyses**, **laboratory experiments**, and **instrumentation design and fabrication** to address changes in past and present glaciers and ice sheets, river systems, sea level, and landscapes.

## Geomorphology and Minnesota

The University of Minnesota is situated at the meeting point of major geologic, physiographic, hydrologic, and ecologic provinces. Here, the wooded hills of the Paleozoic Plateau along the Upper Mississippi Valley meet the edge of the Prairies, and the central lakes meet the rugged cliffs and boreal forests of the Superior Craton and Keweenawan Rift. Waters from Minnesota flow to the Saint Lawrence, Hudson Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico. The topography is a patchwork of ice-stream-generated moraines, glacial outburst flood gorges, and exposed Precambrian tectonic structures.
